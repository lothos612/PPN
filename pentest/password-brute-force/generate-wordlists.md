### hashcat

Potentially valid usernames, `John Doe` as an example:

* [https://activedirectorypro.com/active-directory-user-naming-convention/](https://activedirectorypro.com/active-directory-user-naming-convention/)

```
$ cat << EOF >> passwords.txt
johndoe
jdoe
j.doe

EOF
```

Common usernames:

```
$ cat << EOF >> passwords.txt

```

Common patterns:

```
$ cat << EOF >> passwords.txt

Add year and exclamation point to the end of each password:

```
$ for i in $(cat passwords.txt); do echo "${i}"; echo "${i}\!"; echo "${i}2020"; echo "${i}2020\!"; done > t
$ cp t passwords.txt
```

Mutate the wordlist with hashcat rules:

```
$ hashcat --force --stdout passwords.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/toggles1.rule |sort -u |awk 'length($0) > 7' > t
$ cp t passwords.txt
```
